SECTION C
12. A lens is a portion of a transparent medium bounded by two surfaces and one of these surfaces is essentially spherical. It is used to converge or diverge the light incident on it. Power of a lens is the measure of its ability to converge or diverge the light incident on it. Power of a lens depends on the refractive index of the material of lens with respect to the surrounding medium and the radii of curvature of its two surfaces.
